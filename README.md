HTML5 JavaScript Banner Animation Library
==================

This JavaScript banner animation library intended for use with creating web-based 
animated banners using HTML5's CSS animation capabilties.

One should have a base knowledge of how CSS animations function in order to be 
able to fully use these.

Contained within this library are full, but simple examples of how to use this 
JS library for creating an animated banner. BannerAnimation.js costs about 9KB 
in file size in the minified form.

As the name implies, this JS library makes use of CSS animations to perform 
visual changes. What happens in the background is the JS code generates the CSS 
code and injects it into the HTML and the browser takes over. This library 
generates all the different variants such as "-webkit-" to make sure it will 
play in all browsers that support CSS animations.
